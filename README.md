Machine learning model capable of classifying candidate exoplanets

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, lets create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
In this projecy, we will need to:

1) Preprocess the raw data
2) Tune the models
